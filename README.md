# frontend-code-assignment

## Overview

Welcome! This repository is the starting point for your frontend interview at Epidemic Sound today.

Today, you'll work to build a small UI component with some expected behavior and requirements using HTML, JavaScript/TypeScript, and CSS. You may use any Web framework/library you like, but we encourage you to use React, our preferred frontend library here
at Epidemic Sound.

This live-coding exercise will be conducted in GitHub Codespaces. Your interviewer will guide you some brief set-up before providing you with today's interview question!

GitHub Codespaces are cloud-based development environments built on top of Microsoft VSCode. If you're used to using VSCOde, or really any IDE, you'll feel right at home! You can learn more about Codespaces [by clicking here](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
